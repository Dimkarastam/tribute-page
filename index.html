                Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer. She is mainly known for her work
                on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the
                first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the
                first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine.
